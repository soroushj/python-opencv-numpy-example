# Image Manipulation with OpenCV and NumPy

In this example, we'll:
- Sharpen an image, using an unsharp mask (also available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/soroushj/1217c523f6fe3cd3eccfd67337007e02))
- Convert a color image into a grayscale one, using the Y channel of the YCbCr color space (also available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/soroushj/ce3765e5374bb081f3fdbd8e7f2c2ffa))
